# Image-Editor
In order start my GUI studies, I decided to program a simple image editor, so I used Tkinter (Python).

With it you can:
- Upload images
- Apply filters, such as negative or black and white
- Resize its height and width
- Rotate
- Save

There will always be a display showing the current status of the file, and, if necessary, a text indicating the correct way to use the program's features.
Two scripts were used, one to allocate all methods (commands.py) and another to instantiate and position the frames, widgets and the window (main.py).
